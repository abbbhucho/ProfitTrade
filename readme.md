## About ProfitTrade
	The Project named ProfitTrade allows a user to keep a record of all the
	stocks which are sold or to be sold at a particular date. It also provides
	amount of extra charges applied as per the admin (here in this case is
	the broker) which will be applied as per the time for which the stock is
	kept and also analyses the profit at the end when the stocks are sold.

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Description
	- The Project takes into consideration the need of the user to handle
	his/her stock. While a stockholder face a lot of problems in day to day
	life in handling one’s stocks such as lack of knowledge, fortitude,
	intuition, patience etc. The new stockholders face with the problem of
	having enough experience. On average it takes 5-10 years to learn the
	stock market though with a good mentor or a handler the time
	investment required can be reduced. Not all the stockholders have
	enough qualities needed for investment trading and because of this a
	lot of new stockholders might end up in a loss over a year or two.
	This can lead to loss of interest among the stockholders. The
	stockholder require the right amount of patience as one would have to
	wait for the ‘right time’ to trade.
	The Application ProfitTrade might just act as the handler which one
	might be looking for. One of the sole purposes of this application is to
	calculate all the extra charges that can be applied on the stock as per
	the broker so that the user of the application can avoid being in a loss
	due to insufficient knowledge of the extra charges.
