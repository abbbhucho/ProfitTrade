# Profit Trade

The Project named ProfitTrade allows a user to keep a record of all the
	stocks which are sold or to be sold at a particular date. 

## Description
The Project takes into consideration the need of the user to handle
his/her stock. While a stockholder face a lot of problems in day to day
life in handling ones stocks such as lack of knowledge, fortitude,
intuition, patience etc. The new stockholders face with the problem of
having enough experience. On average it takes 5-10 years to learn the
stock market though with a good mentor or a handler the time
investment required can be reduced. Not all the stockholders have
enough qualities needed for investment trading and because of this a
lot of new stockholders might end up in a loss over a year or two.
This can lead to loss of interest among the stockholders. The
stockholder require the right amount of patience as one would have to
wait for the right time to trade.
The Application ProfitTrade might just act as the handler which one
might be looking for. One of the sole purposes of this application is to
calculate all the extra charges that can be applied on the stock as per
the broker so that the user of the application can avoid being in a loss
due to insufficient knowledge of the extra charges.
